"""Readiness probes for the serving path and the ten integration points.

Two audiences, two shapes, one set of probes.

``serving_readiness`` answers the ``/ready`` endpoint. It reports only the
dependencies the serving path actually needs, because that verdict removes a pod
from the gateway's rotation — including a component the request path can survive
without would take healthy pods out of service for no reason. So Feast is
reported but not mandatory: a cold feature store degrades an answer, it does not
invalidate one.

``integration_report`` answers ``lab28 readiness``. It reads the integration
matrix and attributes each probe to the slide's integration points, which is the
artefact a team shows at the Milestone 3 demo.

Every heavy client is imported inside the probe that uses it. ``qdrant-client``,
``mlflow`` and ``deltalake`` are optional extras, and ``lab28 preflight`` has to
run on a base install — before the student has installed anything else — to tell
them which execution profile they can use.
