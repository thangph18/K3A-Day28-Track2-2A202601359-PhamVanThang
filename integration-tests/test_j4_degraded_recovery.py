"""IT-J4 — what the platform does when a dependency is gone.

Every other journey shows the happy path working. This one takes pieces away
and asserts on the three answers that decide whether an outage becomes an
incident:

*Which failures remove a pod from rotation.* Feast is reported by ``/ready`` but
is not mandatory, so losing it must never turn into a 503 — a 503 takes the pod
out of the gateway's rotation and turns a colder answer into no answer at all.
Qdrant is mandatory, so losing it must produce exactly that 503.

*What a caller gets instead of an error.* A degraded answer is a product
decision, not an accident: it is served, it says so in its evidence, it names
the component that was missing, and it increments a counter an operator can
alert on.

*Whether anything was lost.* A message the pipeline cannot parse is parked with
enough context to diagnose it, the good records in the same batch still land,
and a parked event can be put back on the topic once the defect is fixed.

The absolute-``ready`` assertions carry the ``gpu`` marker rather than a bare
skip: the inference endpoint is a mandatory probe, so on a stack without a real
vLLM the pod is *correctly* not ready and those assertions would be measuring
the missing GPU instead of the failure injection. Everything else is written
against the readiness verdict observed before the injection, so it stays honest
on any stack.
